# Hello-World.C

This repository contains my first C program. The goal is a fundamental programming exercise: displaying the message "Hello, World!" on the console.

The code uses the standard input/output library (stdio.h) and the printf() function, which is essential for communicating with the user via the terminal.

This project represents an initial step in my journey with C, a powerful and widely used language for developing systems, games, and low-level software. The intention is to familiarize myself with the syntax, compilation, and execution of C programs, building a solid foundation for more complex projects in the future.

Along with the use of the Code:Blocks IDE, an integrated development environment designed primarily for the C and C++ languages
